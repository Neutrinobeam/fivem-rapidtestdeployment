# fivem-rapidtestdeployment
Javascript resource allowing Javascript testing and native research from within FiveM

Adds a /rtd chat command that allows entry of Javascript within FiveM.

Usage: /rtd [arguments]
  
  arguments : Optional parameter that is interpreted as Javascript with access to the FiveM natives bindings.
    If arguments has a return value, that value is displayed above the minimap as an alert.
  
  If no arguments are found, a multi-line text input area is displayed. After editing, use the
  Cancel or Confirm button or the Esc or Shift+Enter keys. 
  
Adds alert(string) and log(string) Javascript functions.

  alert(string) displays the string above the minimap.
  log(string) writes the string to server.log in the resources/rapidtestdeployment folder.

Version 1.2

Added chat message that RTD has loaded to first playerSpawn event.

Added log() command, empty server.log file for it to target, and necessary server script for file writing.

/rtd log('Example text'); will write 'Example text' (without the quotes) to server.log.

server.log is overwritten on first player spawn for a client.

log() and server.log may exhibit unintended behavior on a multi-client server (only tested with a single client.)

Version 1.1

Added a text file viewer to the /rtd display.

Select files from the client filesystem to view as a reference.

Forward and backward case sensitive search (Some slowdown on larger than 1MB files.)

How To Install:

Install the rapidtestdeployment folder into your server's resources folder and add 'start rapidtestdeployment'
to your server.cfg.
